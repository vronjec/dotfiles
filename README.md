## Etymology

Dotfiles are plain text configuration files on Unix-like systems for
shell, editor, and other software customizations. They are called
"dotfiles" as they typically are named with a leading `.`, making
them hidden on Unix-like systems by default. In general, dotfiles
end up being extremely specific to an individual developers workflows
and preferences. (Summary based on [thoughtbot](https://thoughtbot.com/)
